     * Create or load an instance of [Postman Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) as a JavaScript
     * object that can be manipulated easily.
     *
     * A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into folders to
     * accurately mirror your API. Requests can also store sample responses when saved in a collection. You can add
     * metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is
     * available easily.
     * @constructor
     * @extends {ItemGroup}
     *
     * @param {Object=} [definition] - Pass the initial definition of the collection (name, id, etc) as the `definition`
     * parameter. The definition object is structured exactly as the collection format as defined in
     * [https://www.schema.getpostman.com/](https://www.schema.getpostman.com/). This parameter is optional. That
     * implies that you can create an empty instance of collection and add requests and other properties in order to
     * build a new collection.
     * @param {Array<Object>=} [environments] - The collection instance constructor accepts the second parameter as an
     * array of environment objects. Environments objects store variable definitions that are inherited by
     * {@link Collection#variables}. These environment variables are usually the ones that are exported from the Postman
     * App to use them with different collections. Refer to Postman
     * [documentation on environment variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments).
     *
     * @example <caption>Load a Collection JSON file from disk</caption>
     * var fs = require('fs'), // needed to read JSON file from disk
     *     pretty = function (obj) { // function to neatly log the collection object to console
     *         return require('util').inspect(obj, {colors: true});
     *     },
     *     Collection = require('postman-collection').Collection,
     *     myCollection;
     *
     * // Load a collection to memory from a JSON file on disk (say, sample-collection.json)
     * myCollection = new Collection(JSON.stringify(fs.readFileSync('sample-collection.json').toString()));
     *
     * // log items at root level of the collection
     * console.log(inspect(myCollection));
     *
     * @example <caption>Create a blank collection and write to file</caption>
     * var fs = require('fs'),
     *     Collection = require('postman-collection').Collection,
     *     mycollection;
     *

     *     info: {
     *         name: "my Collection"
